			<!-- <br>Created for the first time in 2000, this program celebrated Ohad Naharin's ten years of creation within the company by offering a striking collage of excerpts from his repertoire. Regularly  recomposed and enriched since, the piece is today the opportunity, for  the Israeli choreographer,
			<br>
			to show the variety of his inspiration - the  most demonstrative movement to the very intimate expression -, but also  to question the lines of force from his work. More than a set of selected pieces, it is therefore a real re-creation whose repertoire provides the material constantly revisited.
			<br>
			Energetic and sensual, always on the string of emotions, those of the body or those of the soul, the dance becomes its own theater. For the greatest pleasure of the spectator, carried away in a whirlwind of gestures, sounds and unforgettable images served by a troupe at its best.
			<br>Artistic direction: Ohad Naharin -->
